# Salon Booking App - Flutter

A new project with Flutter to learn more complex topics,

Today was a holiday and I woke up in the morning and had coffee and chose a general design from Figma and started to practice, see the final result and if you have a better solution or advice, I will definitely be happy to hear it.
